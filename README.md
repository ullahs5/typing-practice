The website provides real-time Words Per Minute (WPM) updates, enabling users to gauge their typing speed as they practice.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure account creation and login functionality using Spring Boot security.
- **Login Functionality:** Log in securely to access your saved data and settings.

### Authorization Note

**Note:** GitHub Pages supports static websites and does not support server-side processing or authorization. As a result, certain features requiring authorization may not function when accessed through the GitHub Pages deployment.

To fully experience all features, consider running the website locally.
